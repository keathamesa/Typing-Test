1. Project Title:
Typing Test Application

2. Project Issue / Problem to be Solved:
The project aims to provide an engaging platform to improve typing speed and accuracy while tracking user progress over time. The inclusion of login and signup features enhances user personalization, enabling users to store and compare their results.

3. Current Progress (PDLC):

Problem Analysis: Completed. The need for a typing practice and test application with user authentication and progress tracking has been identified.
Design: Implemented. The project includes structured Tkinter-based GUIs for Home, Signup, Login, and Game pages.
Implementation: The application includes functionalities like user registration, login validation, gameplay mechanics, and result tracking.
Testing: In progress, focusing on UI functionality, gameplay logic, and data persistence.
Deployment: Not yet deployed.

4. Project Functions/Features:

Authentication:
User signup (store username/password).
User login (validate credentials).
Typing Game:
Random word display for typing.
Timer to measure speed.
Scoring based on correctly typed words.
Tracking missed words.
Result Tracking:
Store and display past results (e.g., score, time taken).
Show improvements over previous attempts.

5. Expected No. of Pages:

Home Page: Welcome screen with navigation to login or signup.
Signup Page: Form for new user registration.
Login Page: Form for user login.
Game Page: Main gameplay screen with words, timer, and score display.
Result Page (integrated into the Game Page): Displays performance metrics after game completion.

6. Database Applied:

Data Structures:
user_credentials: Dictionary to store usernames and passwords.
previous_results: List to store scores and times for individual users.
Records: No external database is used. All data is stored in memory, making it volatile. Future improvements could involve integrating a database like SQLite.
